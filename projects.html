                <p>Triton Racing is UCSD's Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) team. As a Chassis project lead I spearheaded the design and manufacturing processes of integral components of the car such as the headrest and firewall while assisting in other projects for the aerodynamics package. My time as part of this team has allowed me to see new perspectives in solving issues creatively and efficiently. It is truly incredible to work on a team with so many passionate and driven individuals all working towards building something as ambitious as competition-winning race car.</p>

                <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                    <li>Used CAD and CAM design to build funcitonal parts for a competition-winning Formula One-style race car</li>

                    <li>Manufactured fundamental chassis and aerodynamics components such as headrest, firewall, front and rear wings</li>

                    <li>Modeled testing data to improve vehicle performance in competetive scenarios</li>

                <h3>DSC 80</h3>
                <p>This was my final project in my DSC 80 course which challenged students to create their own data science project from start to finish. I was given only an uncleaned data set and two weeks to make it my own. In this project I took the information of power outages in the United States and built a prediction model to classify the severity of future power outages.</p>

                <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                    <li>Removed 30% of unsightful data using data cleaning and exploratory data analysis</li>

                    <li>Devised DecisionTreeClassifiers and RandomForestClassifiers to create models with 75% testing accuracy and 95% training accuracy</li>

                    <li>Utilized GridSearch and parity analysis to determine optimal parameters and presence of model biases</li>

                <p>As part of the Hack School with the Association for Computing Machinery Hack Division I participated in a quarter-long peer-run program for learning the MERN stack. During these ten weeks, various topics were covered including Web Design, HTML and CSS, Javascript, Python and Node.js. In smaller teams we collaborated to apply the skills we had learned in the development of a finance tracking application.</p>

                <p>Though I had extensive volunteering experience prior to UCSD, my time with Rotaract has been truly remarkable. This club has a committment to building and supporting communities all over San Diego, with efforts to raise funds for Feeding San Diego as well as contributing hundreds of service hours to every part of San Diego. My time wiht Rotaract has allowed me to collaborate with many groups of enthusiastic charity organizations as we worked to find solutions for those in need. As the Marketing Co-Director it will be my mission to ensure that this club's message reaches as many people as possible so that we can continue to support our community with other passionate volunteers.</p>

As an Online Content Writer for DS3 I've had the unique chance to find out more about specific intersections of data science in different industries. My first publication linked above explores how data science works in Formula 1 Racing.</p>
