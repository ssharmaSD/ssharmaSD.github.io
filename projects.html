                <p>Triton Racing is UCSD's Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) team. As part of the Chassis subteam I assisted in the manufacturing process of many integral components of the car such as the headrest and firewall of the vehicle. I also helped in the manufacturing and post-processing of the front and rear wing elements of the aerodynamics package. My time as part of this team has allowed me to see new perspectives in solving issues creatively and efficiently. It is truly incredible to work on a team with so many passionate and driven individuals all working towards building something as ambitious as competition-winning race car.</p>
