              <h3>Data Science Tutor</h3>
              <p> In my first two quarters I spent a lot of time in office hours
                where I found not only support from my peers but also a community. These experiences inspired me to tutor as well. Tutoring as part of  the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute has been an incredibly enriching experience that has allowed me to share my knowledge and passions with others as well as learn from my colleagues. My responsibilities included hosting weekly office hours both in group settings and one-on-one with students, answering student questions on online forums, aiding professors in creating and grading assignments such as homework, labs, and projects for DSC 10: Principles of Data Science.

              <p>Triton Racing is UCSD's Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) team. As part of the Chassis subteam I assisted in the manufacturing process of many integral components of the car such as the headrest and firewall of the vehicle. I also helped in the manufacturing and post-processing of the front and rear wing elements of the aerodynamics package. My time as part of this team has allowed me to see new perspectives in solving issues creatively and efficiently. It is truly incredible to work on a team with so many passionate and driven individuals all working towards building something as ambitious as competition-winning race car.</p>

              <p>In my spare time I enjoy exploring new activities, especially those that allow me to express my creative side. I spend a lot of time reading, especially mysteries and dystopian works with my favorite authors being Margaret Atwood and Anthony Horowitz. I've been drawing since I was much younger and like to try new techniques or methods of drawing whenever I get a chance. On weekends I like to get together with friends to play tennis tournaments or go around exploring the many hiking trails in my local area. I hope to travel in the future, and learn more about other cultures and perspectives</p>
