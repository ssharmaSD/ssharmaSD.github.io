              <p>Hello! My name is Suhani and I am a current Data Science student at UC San Diego. I first started programming in high school where I discovered a passion for software engineering and other technologies. I am interested in data storytelling as well as researching machine learning and AI development.</p>

              <h3>Data Science Tutor</h3>
              <p> In my first two quarters I spent a lot of time in office hours
                where I found not only support from my peers but also a community. These experiences inspired me to tutor as well. Tutoring as part of  the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute has been an incredibly enriching experience that has allowed me to share my knowledge and passions with others as well as learn from my colleagues. My responsibilities included hosting weekly office hours both in group settings and one-on-one with students, answering student questions on online forums, aiding professors in creating and grading assignments such as homework, labs, and projects for DSC 10: Principles of Data Science.

              <h4>TRITON RACING</h4>
              <h5>Chassis Team Member</h5>
              <p>Triton Racing is UCSD's Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) team. As part of the Chassis subteam I assisted in the manufacturing process of many integral components of the car such as the headrest and firewall of the vehicle. I also helped in the manufacturing and post-processing of the front and rear wing elements of the aerodynamics package. My time as part of this team has allowed me to see new perspectives in solving issues creatively and efficiently. It is truly incredible to work on a team with so many passionate and driven individuals all working towards building something as ambitious as competition-winning race car.</p>
