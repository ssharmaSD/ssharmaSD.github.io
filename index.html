            <h2>Welcome to my portfolio website!</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Suhani Sharma and I am a rising third-year undergraduate at UC San Diego studying <strong>Data Science</strong>. I began programming in high school where I first discovered a passion for software engineering and other technologies. I am interested in data storytelling as well as <strong>machine learning and AI development</strong>. I particularly enjoy seeing the many applications of data science in my personal interests.</p>

            <p>Check out some of my projects and experiences!</p>
